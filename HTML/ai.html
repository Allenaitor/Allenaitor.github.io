      <h2>Rebuilding Elizabot</h2>

          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p class="fancy">Here is where you'll explain, briefly, the history of Elizabot.</p>
          <p>ElizaBot, originally known as ELIZA, was created in the 1960s by Joseph Weizenbaum, a computer scientist at MIT. It was one of the first examples of natural language processing and conversational AI. ELIZA used pattern matching and simple scripts to simulate a conversation, most famously imitating a Rogerian psychotherapist. This version of the bot would reflect users' statements back to them as questions or prompts, giving the illusion of understanding and empathy.</p>
          <p>Despite its simplicity, many users were surprised by how real the conversations felt. Some even formed emotional attachments to the program. ELIZA was a major step forward in the field of artificial intelligence because it showed that machines could simulate aspects of human dialogue without true understanding. Over time, ELIZA has inspired countless other chatbot projects and remains a foundational example in both computer science and digital humanities.</p>
          <p>The version I modified keeps the basic structure and keyword-response system of the original ELIZA but changes the theme from a therapist to a prophetic oracle.</p>
          <p class="fancy">Here is where you'll explain the changes you made and why</p>
          <p>For this project, I changed the original ElizaBot from a 1960s-style therapist chatbot into a mysterious prophecy oracle called Ashley. Instead of acting like a modern-day therapist, my version speaks more like a fortune-teller or an old storyteller who gives strange and poetic answers. The idea was to make it feel like the user is talking to someone with ancient wisdom, who answers with riddles and dramatic language, like the witches in old plays or stories.</p>
          <p>I changed the main part of the bot by adding new words and categories to the <code>elizaKeywords</code> list. These focus on big ideas people often wonder about when asking for a prophecy: the future, destiny, love, fear, hope, and life or death. Every response now sounds more like old-fashioned poetry. For example, if someone asks, “What is my future?” the bot might reply, “The stars speak in whispers, but thy path remains thine to choose.” This change makes the bot feel more magical and less like a normal chatbot.</p>
          <p>I also added keywords for things like dreams, signs, stars, and fate which are words that help build the feeling of mystery and wonder. These make the bot feel more alive and fuller of imagination, like something out of a legend or myth. Now, the bot acts more like a riddle-speaking guide, asking the user to think about what its strange answers might mean.</p>
          <p>The tone and word choice were carefully changed to match this theme, using older-sounding phrases and dramatic lines. The result is a completely new kind of chatbot experience, one that feels like a conversation with a storyteller or seer, giving hints and visions instead of clear answers. It turns ElizaBot into something more creative and magical.</p>
          <p class="fancy">Here is where you'll assess your outcomes--does this bot work well?</p>
          <p>Overall, the prophecy-themed ElizaBot works well and fulfills its intended purpose. The transformation from a therapist into a mystical oracle is successful as the tone, language, and responses all reflect a more poetic and mysterious style. When a user types in a question, especially one about their future, their fears, or their destiny, the bot replies in a way that feels dramatic, cryptic, and otherworldly.</p>
          <p>The keyword system continues to function effectively. The new words I added, such as “future,” “fate,” “destiny,” “sign,” and “dream,” are common ideas people associate with prophecy, so users are likely to type them in naturally. Because of this, the bot is able to catch these words and provide responses that fit the prophecy theme. The poetic language and sentence structures also help immerse users in the mood and tone of an ancient seer.</p>
          <p>However, one limitation is that the bot still relies heavily on keyword matching, which mostly hurts the experience. When a user’s input doesn’t contain a keyword or includes a more complex idea, the response may feel random or disconnected. This can pull the user out of the immersive, mystical atmosphere. Unlike true oracles, which feel deeply insightful even in vagueness, the bot sometimes sounds like it’s guessing or repeating itself. This mechanical side is more noticeable when the response doesn’t match the question in tone or content.</p>
