          <p class="fancy"><b>E-Commerce Website Development Project</b></p>
          <p class="fancy">I had the opportunity to develop an e-commerce website as part of a hands-on assignment. The project required me to think like an entrepreneur and create a fictional online store, which involved designing a company name, logo, tagline, and mission statement. I was tasked with building a website that sold at least seven products/services, each with detailed descriptions, while incorporating features such as a form for submitting customer information and client-side interactivity like on-click and on-hover events. I integrated JSON data to dynamically display product information, and used Font Awesome icons for visual enhancement and Bootstrap to ensure the website was fully responsive across different devices. To personalize the site, I started with a free CSS template and modified it extensively, making over 20 changes using HTML, CSS, and jQuery, which sharpened my coding skills. Through this project, I gained practical experience in e-commerce web development, learned how to design user-friendly and interactive websites, and developed a stronger understanding of responsive design and client-side functionality.
